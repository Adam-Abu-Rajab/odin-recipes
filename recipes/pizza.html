    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough (can be store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (pizza sauce or marinara)</li>
        <li>Cheese (mozzarella is the most common)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (optional, for brushing the crust)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C) or as hot as your oven allows. A hot oven gives a crispy crust.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or baking sheet. If you have parchment paper, use it to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese generously on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Brush the crust with olive oil (optional, for a golden crust).</li>
        <li>Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
