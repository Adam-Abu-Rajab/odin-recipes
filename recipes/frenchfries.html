    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French fries are made from potatoes that have been cut into thin strips, washed briefly in cold water, partly dried to remove surface moisture and deep fried in vegetable oil to a light golden colour</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large potatoes</li>
        <li>Oil for frying (vegetable, canola, or peanut oil)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel & Cut the Potatoes , Peel the potatoes (or leave the skin on for a rustic style). Cut them into thin strips or your preferred fry shape.</li>
        <li>Soak in Water , Place the cut potatoes in cold water for 30 minutes to remove excess starch (makes them crispier).
        </li>
        <li>Dry the Potatoes , Drain and pat them completely dry using a kitchen towel.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the Oil , Heat oil in a deep pan or fryer to about 350째F (175째C).
        </li>
        <li>First Fry (Blanching) , Fry the potatoes in batches for about 3-4 minutes until soft but not browned. Remove and let them rest.
        </li>
        <li>Second Fry (Crisping) , Increase oil temperature to 375째F (190째C). Fry the potatoes again until golden brown and crispy (about 2-3 minutes).
        </li>
    </ol>
